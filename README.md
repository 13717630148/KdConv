# KNIVES

KNIVES is a Chinese multi-domain **KN**owledge-dr**IVE**n conversion**S**ation dataset, grounding the topics in multi-turn conversations to knowledge graphs. KNIVES contains **4.5K** conversations from **three** domains (film, music, and travel), and **86K** utterances with an average turn number of **19.0**. These conversations contain in-depth discussions on related topics and natural transition between multiple topics, while the corpus can also used for exploration of transfer learning and domain adaptation.

We provide several benchmark models to facilitate the following research on this corpus. (The benchmark codes will be released later)
